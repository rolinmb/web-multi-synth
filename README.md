JavaScript Web Audio API Multi-Oscillator Synthesizer (written in TypeScript). Maps keyboard keys to notes using 12-tone equal temperment tuning, similar to FL Studio.

TODO:
  - If you play too many notes or are playing around with parameters and a lot of notes are playing it can cause the application to crash; which you can simply restart with a page reload (but still would like to prevent crashes)
  - add more master distortion types
