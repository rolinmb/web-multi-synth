JavaScript Web Audio API Multi-Oscillator Synthesizer (written in TypeScript). Maps keyboard keys to notes using 12-tone equal temperment tuning, similar to FL Studio.

TODO:
  - playing too many notes or if you are playing around with parameters and a lot of notes are pressed it can cause the application to crash / strutter / leave notes playing when releasing the key; which you can simply restart with a page reload to fix (but still would like to prevent crashes)
  - can add other effects like stereo panning, convolver, delay, filtering
  - could make the effects modular; as in the user can add / change order of effects (more complicated obviously)
