JavaScript Web Audio API Multi-Oscillator Synthesizer (written in TypeScript). Maps keyboard keys to notes using 12-tone equal temperment tuning, similar to FL Studio.

TODO:
  - Custom Waveform does not come through audio context no matter what its gain is set to (i.e. need to troubleshoot or look at more docs)
  - Add more mapped Notes as per equal temperment tuning
  - Add dropdown for distortion oversampling
